/user/id/979617167,3.5,"Better Call Saul season 1 is good, but its nothing over the top. They show some of Saul's backstory throughout more backstories which I found interesting. Mike had some great acting points and moments with some bad ass scenes mixed in. ""Pimento"" has that particular scene. My personal favourite episode is ""Marco"" in season 1 that's the most emotionally driven episode! 7.7/10 overall for first season!!",6d ago,1

/user/id/975004428,4.5,"An incredibly surprising prequel to a previous work I hold in the highest regard, Better Call Saul shows almost immediately how quality of a storyteller Vince Gilligan is. It's a slow burn to start, but reveals itself as an unbelievably quality predecessor to Breaking Bad. As long as you can forgive slight timeline and character inconsistencies that are inevitable for shows attempting what BCS is, you're in for as great of a ride as you can expect.","Apr 07, 2022",1
/user/id/978201545,5.0,"In some ways this is my favorite season of Better Call Saul. The slow pacing gives us time to really sit and think about what is going on in our protagonist's mind. The way Gould and Gilligan crafted the relationships between Jimmy and Chuck, Jimmy and Kim, Jimmy and Howard, etc, without really knowing where these relationships would end up- they just did such a phenomenal job. It's just pure story telling perfection.

There are so many great moments in this season that I won't even bother listing any. If you haven't seen it, watch it NOW. And if you are one of those who was expecting the plot-driven pacing of this show and feel it drags: Just PLEASE get through the first season. The revelation toward the end, I truly believe, will hook you. This is supreme quality television. It does not get better than this show.","Mar 24, 2022",1
/user/id/976231154,5.0,"This show is fantastic on all levels and superior to it's predecessor ""Breaking Bad.""  The ""Saul Goodman"" character was the comic relief in a gritty/dark/depressing ""Breaking Bad"" series.  A show that's all about ""Saul"" is far more enjoyable.","Jan 20, 2022",1

Gilligan is still a great story teller and isn't afraid to let you sit on a scene. But it is clear he learned his lesson from Breaking Bad and this story starts off a lot stronger. It's full of compelling characters and stories and the episodes never leave you bored or incredulous. But at the same time I was never super driven to watch the next episode.

/user/id/977694002,4.5,"The first season of the Breaking Bad spin-off, Better Call Saul is a suprisingly funny, dark mix of a comedy and a drama, that has a totally different tone from Breaking Bad. Bob Odenkirk is always a pleasure to see in his role of a lifetime, and everyone else is really great too. This first season manages to stay rather slow paced, but still very much entertaining. It ends with a nostalgic and sad tone, and it flows perfectly into the second season. If this keeps up, I might like Better Call Saul more than Breaking Bad itself.","Jul 28, 2020",1

Simply one of the best shows on tv, alongside Breaking bad, obviously..","Apr 21, 2020",1
/user/id/978148537,5.0,"Very often a spin-off of a show that was wildly successful and popular is doomed to be inferior and less appealing. Better Call Saul avoids this trap with a solid narrative, well-realized characters and impeccable writing. Vince Gilligan and Peter Gould lead the way in crafting an extension of the Breaking Bad universe. Their writing prowess has clearly taken a giant step forward as the story takes it's time building the characters and immersing the viewer in an engrossing and realistic world. However, it is not dependent on what came before it. Some overlap exists of course, but the world here has a unique feel that differs from Breaking Bad. Bob Odenkirk leads the way with a performance that is on the level of Cranston as White. His emotional journey in this premiere season ranges from tragic to triumphant, and you're never left wondering how this truly captivating character feels. Jonathan Banks as Mike also shines. His standalone episode was perhaps the best of the ten, and his story gripped me in a way that I never could have anticipated. Rhea Seehorn and Michael McKean are also excellent as Kim and Chuck, respectively. Really, there are no weak links at all, which is one of the very few issues I had with Breaking Bad. Each character here has it's place. The direction and camerawork are as good as one might expect, leaving little to no room for criticism in that aspect. By the end, I wanted to immediately start season two. Rarely does a show reach heights such as this one, especially when the predecessor that spawned it is widely regarded as on of the greatest TV shows in history. Better Call Saul may be up there as well.","Apr 15, 2020",1

/user/id/551848470,4.0,"For the die hard fans of Breaking Bad, the series ending was a crushing blow, and as is the case with the more popular series, few were happy with the way it ended. The fans wouldn't be disappointed for long however, as it was soon announced that fan favorite, Bob Odenkirk, who played shady lawyer Saul Goodman, would be getting his own spin-off and once again Vince Gilligan and the beloved genre he created lived on.

Better Call Saul is not what most of us expected it to be, as we assumed, Saul wouldn't stay where he was after the events of the Breaking Bad finale, and that we'd come to see what's next, but in fact, it's just the opposite. The series begins with a depressed and sentimental Saul, taking a look back at where it all started, back when he was kind of an honest man, who kind of cared about a few people, and went by his real name, James McGill. McGill was a con-artist who was frequently bailed out by his brother (Michael McKean) who was a big time lawyer at a huge firm. It was he who convinced Jimmy to turn his life around and try to follow in his footsteps and that's what he did....kind of.

Lets start with the show, because it is every bit as clever and well written as Breaking Bad was. You might not have the shocking violence, at least not yet, but as with it's predecessor, the show is always three steps ahead of you, it's clever, humorous in that dry kind of way, and it is extremely entertaining.

Also similar to Breaking Bad, you have some great side characters, but one man is the show, and that man is Bob Odenkirk. If you thought he was good on Breaking Bad, you haven't seen anything yet. By the time he was Saul, he was a complete con-man, everything was a joke or a scam, but Jimmy, he hasn't really crossed that line completely, he has his moments, but he still has his humanity and compassion. That internal struggle between doing what's right and doing what he deems is necessary is at the heart of the show, and Bob Odenkirk is the heart and soul of the show.

The bottom line, Better Call Saul is not on the same level as Breaking Bad...YET, but it's headed that way. What did you think of Breaking Bad after twenty episodes? Did you feel the same way as you did after sixty? That's the point, Saul is feeling his oats, building his story and his reputation. As for Vince Gilligan, he learned from his mistakes and I think people are going to catch on and get hooked a lot faster this time around. This show has the same feel to it and things are only going to get bigger and better, so if you're putting off on watching it until you start hearing more hype, that's your choice, but you're missing out on some pretty good stuff.","Jun 14, 2017",1

/user/id/783105400,4.0,"When I first heard that Vince Gilligan was working on Breaking Bad spinoff ""Better Call Saul"", I dismissed it as an oddly-conceived cash grab for AMC. I mean, seriously...a show all about Saul Goodman? Nah, that'll never work...right? But then, something a bit strange happened: All the pre-show reviews/buzz gave it incredibly high marks. It got picked up for a second season before the pilot even aired! All of that being said, I settled in to watch that opening episode with very low expectations. 10 episodes later, I was amazed by the quality of the show and the continued genius of its creators. If only I could figure out what the heck kind of a show it is (or wants to be)!

The basic premise of ""Better Call Saul"" sees Jimmy McGill (Bob Odenkirk), essentially a con-man, trying to make it in public law defense while running schemes on the side. He's got a cramped office (in the back of a salon owned by a number of Asian women), crashes with brother Chuck (Michael McKean), a once-great lawyer who Jimmy reveres, but now has some sort of strange sensitivity to electronics (or is it all just in his head?), and seems to have very little future. He is connected to the law firm managed by Howard Hamlin (Patrick Fabian), primarily through a female friend Kim Wexler (Rhea Seehorn), but doesn't seem to be too well-received around the place. Oh yes, and let's not forget...the ""ticket-taker"" parking lot attendant just happens to be a stone-faced figure named Mike Ehrmantraut (Jonathan Banks).

It's very tough for me to describe a show like ""Better Call Saul"", because to be honest, I've never quite seen a show like it. Whereas some TV shows produce serial episodes (like Breaking Bad did) and others take a more ""plot of the week approach"" (think Person Of Interest in its most basic form), this show manages to do both at the exact same time. Each episode is about something almost completely different than the next...yet there is still tremendous amounts of character growth from beginning to end.

I won't throw in any absurd spoilers here (maybe some minor ones), but when the show begins, it looks to really be skirting off the coattails of Breaking Bad's success. Nacho Varga (Michael Mando) makes a very quick appearance, and just the whole look/feel/vibe of the show screams ""BB nostalgia!"". By the third episode, however, the show turns into Jimmy's quest to change from ""Slippin' Jimmy"" to a respectable lawyer. Just as soon as that has happened, the show takes an abrupt aside to focus on Mike for an entire episode before its back to Jimmy & Co. Towards the end, more time is given to Jimmy's strange relationship with brother Chuck, female friend Kim, and a potentially new career path that could offer him some legitimacy...if he chooses to fully embrace it.

Suffice it to say, this show shifts gears quicker than Slippin' Jimmy himself can concoct another rip-off scheme! I can honestly say I've never seen a show cover so much ground (and diverse ground at that) in the span of just 10 episodes. The plots/scenarios of the show play on a very interesting dynamic: even though the viewers know exactly who/what ""Jimmy"" will become, we tend to forget that while we are watching because the stories/characters are so engrossing. Just when we (as viewers) think we have everything ""figured out"", however, we are always reminded that we know exactly how this Jimmy character is going to turn out. So, the show really taps into two distinct emotional areas: The one where we WANT Jimmy to do something, and the one where we KNOW he is going to do something...the question just being ""when?""

Yet, despite all the praise I have heaped on the show so far, I can't give it the full five stars for this opening campaign for one main reason: I really just don't know what I am watching yet. It's like each episode is a non sequitur. A very entertaining non sequitur, to be sure, but just all over the map in terms of plot from episode to episode. Like I said previously, I've never watched a show like this before...one in which I enjoy it each week but can't quite put my finger on how/why.

Putting things into perspective, though, I actually thought that ""Better Call Saul"" had a more intriguing initial season than its cousin ""Breaking Bad"" (which I felt took a whole season and a half to really find the base of the characters). This show does it in the opening scene of the opening episode...tight from the word ""go"". I enjoyed each and every episode, and will be waiting patiently until the next installment of Jimmy McGill's inevitable journey towards Saul Goodman.","Feb 25, 2017",1

Introducing Jimmy McGill (played by Bob Odenkirk).  You may know him better as Saul Goodman, Walter White's slippery, resourceful lawyer in Breaking Bad.  When first we meet him it is a few years before he meets Walter White.  He is a struggling lawyer in Albuquerque, New Mexico.  He mostly defends small-time crooks and represents people in civil liability claims (much of which amounts to nothing more than ambulance chasing).  His brother, Charles ""Chuck"" McGill (Michael McKean), is a senior partner at a prestigious Albuquerque law firm but hasn't left his house for several months due to a strange affliction.  Jimmy is supporting him through bringing him groceries and the like.  Jimmy has a dark, pre-lawyer past, being a small-time fraudster in Chicago before moving to Albuquerque to start over and work with at his brother's firm.  We also meet Mike Ehrmantraut (Jonathan Banks), ex-cop now working as a toll booth attendant at the courthouse parking lot.  We see how Jimmy and Mike's stories converge and how Jimmy slowly becomes the Saul Goodman we know from Breaking Bad. 

Good drama series: engaging with some interesting episode-specific stories and solid season/series-wide stories.  Great character depth - we see how Jimmy got to where he is and what makes him tick.  Decent depth to secondary characters too.

Not as compelling a watch as Breaking Bad though.  Part of the problem is you know how Jimmy/Saul is going to end up, and you want him to get there as soon as possible.  Saul Goodman was a wonderfully colourful character in Breaking Bad - funny, very resourceful and not above underhanded means to achieve ends.  Jimmy McGill (in Season 1, at least) isn't even a shadow of Saul Goodman.  So the longer the Jimmy part is drawn out and the Saul part delayed, the more impatient you get.

This said, and because of this, I can't wait for Season 2.","Dec 28, 2015",1

Following up the greatest tv show of all time with a prequel then, sounded like a really precipitous idea, trying to make any kind of follow up to Vince Gilligan's peerless mega masterpiece Breaking Bad seemed doomed to blemish the perfection that was achieved. But Better Call Saul, following the exploits of everyone's favorite ""criminal"" lawyer, and one of the best characters in the show, is remarkably well conceived on every level. It works as a stand alone show and is even better as insanely smart fan servicing, with returning characters like the truly wonderful Johnathan Banks as another of Bad's best characters, everyone's fave killer granpa, the hard as nails, taciturn, and loveable Mike Ehrmantraut, and Banks gets to show us layers and depths of the beloved character that where only hinted at before, it's immensely satisfying seeing him get his own story and so much more meat to chew on, he's incredible and prone to make you well up as much as smile at his utter, casual badassery. But this is Bob Odenkirks show, he fleshes out Jimmy McGill, the who would be Saul, beautifully, as you realize SPOILER that Saul really is Jimmy's Heisenberg, and that we are in fact watching a different character, a down trodden, immensely likable no-hoper trying not to back slide and do the right thing, it's gonna be a fascinating transformation.

The tone is different, the character are different, the motivations are different, whilst at the same time, there's a sense of familiarity thanks to the setting, cinematography and way the show is made. 

Frankly, 10 episodes felt like little to help the show escalate into something grand. Much like Breaking Bad, which also started very slowly, maybe we'll start to have those incredibly tense shenanigans with the cartels soon, thanks to Jimmy's big decision on the last episode. It has room to grow and interesting enough characters to back his transformation but things really need to start picking up the pace, despite being a show that makes legal talk and action more interesting than the subject has any right to.","Apr 24, 2015",1

/user/id/931412053,4.5,"""You're like a troll under a bridge. I WANT STICKERS! STICKERS! STICKERS!"". Good old Saul Goodman.

After the brilliant ending to one of the best shows on the plant Breaking Bad the creators had a long talk of a spin-off to one of the characters from that show and that's Saul Goodman the best lawyer you could dream for. With many new shows that are coming out that got a lot of people talking well Better Call Saul was the show that I was waiting for and more excited for and after seeing all the episodes I wasn't disappointed with the show, actually it's really good.

Bob Odenkirk as Saul Goodman was pure brilliant and always such a joy to watch his character reaching to be the best but everything always seems to back fire on him and it get's more hard as everything seems like a challenge that he can't beat, and Bob Odenkirk cough all the stress, the hard work and the good sense of humor that we all know is Saul. Good work Bob.

Jonathan Banks as Mike stole the whole show for me as I think Jonathan Banks did one of the best performance of the year with the heartbreaking episode Five-O, well to be honest I think I named off the things I wanted to say about his performance so check out my review Five-O to know more.

The writing is the highlight of this show as Better Call Saul hasn't got exploding cars or over the top kills that wouldn't happen in real life when you think deep about it. Some people may think this show is boring with people talking and I really don't get what people are saying that, I don't go into a show expecting gun shootouts or people making cheesy one liners, no I want great writing, a good story and a show that can suck me in with all of that and this TV show dose.

If I have to find one problem with the first season is one of the episodes known as Alpine Shepherd Boy and let me get this out there this isn't a terrible episode, it was okay but I think it kind of pointless episode, just watch and you may agree or not but to me it felt fill, but besides that the rest of the episodes are amazing and truly outstanding.

/user/id/907743641,4.0,"A really good set up for an iconic show. Better Call Saul succeeds on giving us new characters to root for in the Breaking Bad universe and the returning cast members from Breaking Bad come back in some of their best work since then. Bob Odenkirk is the perfect actor to play the character of Jimmy McGill and he delivered 100% on this show. Vince Gilligan comes back to put his touch on this show and he did a great job reintroducing us to the characters we loved from Breaking Bad. The stories we got to see provide new and interesting directions for these characters to get into and hopefully the show continues to provide great set up for how these people are in Breaking Bad. One of the new stand out actors in this new show is Michael McKean. He was fantastic here as Jimmy's brother Chuck and you really cared for him in every episode he was in. Another stand out was Jonathan Banks as Mike. You get more back story on him and the Five-O episode stood out as one of the best of the whole show. Another thing that Vince Gilligan brought back was Breaking Bad's dark humor, it was subtle and it made the show even better. Rhea Seehorn did good as Kim and as the show continues on, I hope to care for her even more. I would say my only big issue was the start of the show. It did take a little while for me to get fully invested in the show but as it went on, it got better and better.

/user/id/782851126,5.0,"As much as we all loved Breaking Bad, much of its fan base was highly skeptical about the thought of one of its side characters getting a spin-off/prequel series. Would it just be a cash grab? Could Bob Odenkirk hold his own as a leading man? Were some lingering plot lines in Breaking Bad better left a secret? All considerable concerns, but creators Vince Gilligan and Peter Gould have given us a series that has trumped our expectations in every way.

Better Call Saul's call to existence is that it gives us a very different type of anti-hero. As we know from the previous show, Saul Goodman is a sleazy and conniving con-man, but he's fully watchable for his confidence and prevalent sense of humor. His origin, however, even gives us sympathy for the man, as we see his moments of gold-heartedness and struggles towards adaptation. Star Bob Odenkirk made a name for himself as one of the best alternative comedians back in his hey-day, but he's shown his abilities as a character actor over the years, and he truly has a long-deserved spot light here.

Yet it's not just Saul that makes the show great. Gilligan and Gould also give exposure to other Breaking Bad characters (including a particularly transcendent episode dedicated to fan-favorite Mike Ehrmantraut), while also recapturing the tone of that parent series in a much different way. It still has the top-notch cinematography, story pacing, and surreal editing that made Breaking Bad television's greatest pulp narrative, just aligned with the more retro and comic pathos that comes from its main character. If 2014 felt empty for you cause you didn't have any time with Walter White and Jesse Pinkman, then fear not. Better Call Saul is already looking to be just as brilliant!","Apr 07, 2015",1

Usually spinoffs for a great television show is not very good but Better Call Saul proves that spinoffs could be actually good. Better Call Saul is the prequel to one of the greatest shows ever put on television which is Breaking Bad. This prequel focuses on lawyer Saul Goodman and you get to learn about his character before Breaking Bad. Saul was a great character from Breaking Bad but he was hardly in the series. Saul is like Matlock but if Matlock was a crook then you have Saul Goodman. Bob Odenkirk is fantastic as Saul Goodman and the supporting cast is also great. Every episode was interesting and has really great writing. The show is also very funny but it's best described as a dark comedy.

Mercifully, we are in perfectly capable and often exemplary custodianship with this spin-off, but not knock-off, of Vince Gilligans sad American fable. For those who arent familiar with Heisenbergs misdeeds, theres little sense in starting here. The story is perfectly comprehensible, the script is sharp, the characters are genuine and Albuquerque looks as pretty as it always did. But coming to Better Call Saul with only a casual knowledge of its parent show will not only do a terrible disservice to a show whose bolshiness is rarely seen in modern American mainstream television, but also to yourself as a discerning and selective television consumer. I dont doubt your seriousness. Please come back when you already know what happens. Youll care much more about whats happening.

Breaking Bad was one of my all time favorite series and while I wasn't expecting this to be as good, I was certainly expecting a decent show with good writing, characters, etc. Right off the bat from Episode 1, this show started a bit off, it was a bit intriguing at first when setting up all the characters to see where they would all go, but there was just something about the writing that was just.....sloppier. Many of the scripts felt very underwritten and resorted to bad puns or scenes that just felt unreal like S'all good man or even when Tuco made the deal with Saul to let the skate boarders go by just breaking their legs. Episodes 1 and 2 were the most interesting while the episodes past that became less interesting, more unrealistically goofy, and just plain boring in general. Why this even has 100% on RT is beyond me but so far these first five episodes have been kind marginal. I'll stick it out through the rest of Season 1 but I might stop watching if this just gets lame.

/user/id/838386910,3.5,"I think the challenge to any prequel is that everyone knows the forth act  so the journey itself better be captivating.  Most failed prequels get bogged down in trying to overexplain the past or send too many love letters to their source material thus cheapening or changing the legendary source story or characters. 

Thus far Better Call Saul is doing alright, and the train wreck of Saul Goodman's legally questionable career has stayed entertaining.  I am however concerned with the slow pace which has not kept me as captivated as I would like and that Saul himself not as easy to relate to as Walter White.  But the crazy story turns, excellent albuquerque-ness of of the visuals, and a wild spot on appearance by Tuco Salamanca has brought just enough of the ""Breaking Bad"" look and feel to keep me cautiously optimistic.","Feb 22, 2015",1

/user/id/915734501,5.0,"Better Call Saul Season 1 was definitely very slow, but I loved it! This isn't a pointless cash grab, and there are plenty of satisfying character moments.","Feb 22, 2015",1
/user/id/954046228,5.0,"I usually kept my expectations low when it comes to something that I am excited for which is ironic since I kept my expectations low on something exciting. I hope you get it what I mean here. This trick usually works and the premiere episodes of Better Call Saul is no exception.

Better Call Saul has this Breaking Bad vibe with its tone and pace that is not trying way too hard to be like its parent show and that makes Better Call Saul a great standalone TV show with nods of its parent show Breaking Bad.

This show is a great opportunity to flesh out Saul Goodman, the comedic relief character on Breaking Bad. In his own show, this is where we see him as a human being trying to make a buck as a lawyer with lots of emotions ranging from being funny as hell to being depressed as hell. Bob Odenkirk did a great job playing and expanding the character that made him famous and its nice to see that the funniest man on Breaking Bad is actually really sad as well.

I loved how the first two episodes sets up on whats to come this season. The way how the plot was organized, the great writing from a great writing staff as well as the right slow pace makes this show entertaining and interesting at the same time.

The directing and the cinematography in this show is excellent and pleasing to watch. I am glad this style of filming is carried over from Breaking Bad to Better Call Saul because that style of filming is one of the factors that makes Breaking Bad one of the greatest shows of this generation.

So far, I am enjoying the show and I really cant wait to see how the rest of the season plays out.  This might be too early to call but Better Call Saul is on its way to become a better show than Breaking Bad. Well see if this is true.","Feb 22, 2015",1
/user/id/834669192,5.0,"So far, so good. Better Call Saul is an intriguing dark yet funny look into what makes James McG--uuuuh, Saul Goodman tick as a character. Gilligan and Gould have stayed close to what made Breaking Bad a hit show, but have allowed themselves the liberty to make Better Call Saul a little easier to stomach...so far. Odenkirk's performance as Saul is definitely worthy of praise, as he peels off the layers to James McGill and really fleshes out a character that viewers of Breaking Bad loved from the get-go. The references to the original show are welcome, especially seeing as they do not carry the show, rather enhance its reach by really anchoring it in the Breaking Bad universe.

Creator Vince Gilligans questionable black-and-white portrayal of the middle-aged working-class cliche notwithstanding, The Ink Spots Address Unknown provides an astutely apt backing for Saul Goodmans circumstances in the present. Anonymous, balding and creepy-moustache-sporting, we meet the former criminal lawyer dispassionately slaving away in a sweet treat eatery. Despite our certainty of his identity initially, theres a satisfaction to be gained when its soon confirmed by a TV screen.

Rewind to 2002, were introduced to Jimmy McGill; Saul before Saul. After practicing surrounded by urinals and cubicles, Jimmy strides into a courtroom in an extremely entertaining attempt to convince a jury that his three teenage clients were just fooling around when they performed oral sex on a corpse. A failed attempt, I might add.

Bob Odenkirk brings forth the residual, resounding charismatic spark for which he attained a vast fan base in Breaking Bad. However such charisma is met with a burning frustration and insecurity relating to his failure to launch a successful legal practise. Theres a symmetry between him and Walter White in where they begin. As Walt became Heisenberg, this series will see Jimmy McGill become Saul Goodman.

Fans will be able to spot immediately that the two shows have the same creators. The visual metaphors entertain, such as Jimmys one-on-one with a rubbish bin following an unsuccessful venture previous. The atmosphere encapsulates and the same bad-to-worse, frying-pan-to-fire mayhem so popular with the shows predecessor amuses.

Is it as good as Breaking Bad? Its too soon to tell. Does it establish its own identity as a highly entertaining character profile? Definitely.

I wont say if you love Breaking Bad, watch this although itd be a valid statement. If you want to witness an exceptional character attempting to achieve his own version of the American Dream, this is a good place to start. Rating: 9/10","Feb 19, 2015",1

In order to create loyalty with a character you have to care about that character.  After 3 episodes, I can safely say I don't care about Saul at all and probably won't be continuing the series.

However, that's not a bad thing, necessarily. Saul's development as Jimmy McGill is top-notch and tremendously real, even if the show does get a bit wacky.

/user/id/978201545,5.0,"Season two is amazing. Just, amazing. We really see how set the tone of the show is here. Our trusty writers have gone over every inch of this story with a fine toothed comb, and are telling us a story through every inch of our screens! The montages, the use of color, the themes- just everything. Every single person on this cast and crew deserves an Emmy for their work here. 

We have completely gotten behind Jimmy at this point. We want nothing more than to see him succeed, because he is SO capable of doing so! Or, so it seems. We want so much for him and Kim to live happily ever after in their parallel private practices. We just wish Chuck would get a grip and admit his brother is worthy of being proud of. We *know* that none of this is going to happen. Yet, we hold out hope.

I want to share the episode that may actually be my #1 favorite BCS episode. I've watched it so many times, I couldn't even count. It's episode 8 ""Fifi"", and the opening is a one take shot at customs. That scene is amazing in it's own right, but it's not the real reason I love this one. ""Fifi"" has, what I believe is, the most underrated montage ever. The photocopy shop doctoring scene. A scene with a middle aged man cutting and pasting documents under fluorescent lighting should not be something I just have to go back to over and over again. It makes no sense.

/user/id/978148537,5.0,"In it's second season, Better Call Saul further drew me in to the character drama and expanded the fascinating world of criminal law and the surreptitious economy. This season is defined by continuously changing circumstances that put the characters at odds and push them in to revealing who they truly are. The acting is stupendous. Odenkirk (Jimmy) is great of course, and Banks (Mike) continues to be one of the more compelling characters on television, but Rhea Seehorn (Kim) and Michael McKean (Chuck) have truly arrived as a critical piece to this story. Their performances are nuanced and poignant, and the characters they play represent a divide in the life of Jimmy McGill. How will that play into him becoming Saul Goodman? Now, the writing is absolutely outstanding. This creative team once again shows off their insane talent by writing a realistic and riveting character drama. The feud between Chuck and Jimmy has reached even greater tension, and the future looks bleak for them. The finale's cliffhanger shows that their relationship now hangs in the balance. Kim and Jimmy's dynamic continues to fascinate, and I'm hoping to one day see her perched in front of the Constitution with an eccentric hustler, maundering on as she justify's her position even further. That seems unlikely, but who knows, right? The cartel world is also well and thriving in this season. Michael Mando (Nacho) continues to be an intriguing newcomer to this world. His plight in the business is understandable and he never appears like a horrible person, just someone who got mixed up with the wrong crowd and now has to deal with the consequences. He is relateable, and I'm interested to see what happens with his character. All in all, this is a superb season of television.

/user/id/978143319,3.5,"Just as good as the last season, however the link between Jimmy's and Mike's stories weaken significantly, and it's especially frustrating when it focuses too much on Mike's, which is (in my opinion) less interesting than that of Jimmy; however it does get more exciting near the end. Easily the best part of the show is the dynamic between Jimmy and Chuck, whose once brotherly relationship has been strained by Chuck's revealed lack of respect for his brother, which, despite being a rather cold betrayal (especially at the end of season 1 when he purposefully prevented Jimmy from getting a job) is actually quite understandable. By this point I think this show would be better off if they just cut Mike out completely, or at least incorporate him into the story in a way that's more in conjunction with the A plot (which at points feels like a B plot when Mike's taking up so much screentime). Overall, the show is still good even when some episodes begin to lose my interest, and I would recommend this to anyone who's seen the first season.

P.S - When I watched the first three seasons I never even noticed that there was a change in openings between season one and two. Even though the imagery and music are the same, the ones in season 2 (and 3) alternate the screen's colours between black-and-white and the oversaturated film of the openings in season 1, which is a pretty clever metaphor for the show.

/user/id/783105400,4.0,"The first season of Better Call Saul was all about establishing legitimacy...proving that it could set itself apart from (while still existing in the same universe as) Breaking Bad. It passed that test with flying colors! In this second season, then, the show would be allowed some room to breathe and settle in to what it really wanted to be. For the most part, it was a solid season, filled with the same quirky Vince Gilligan longform storytelling. It also, however, perhaps begins to push the boundaries of how slow a story can unfold over the course of a season.

For a basic plot summary (some spoilers included), this season does an abrupt 180 from where the first one left off. Jimmy McGill (Bob Odenkirk) decides to take a job at Davis & Main after all, where he gets the cocobolo desk and seemingly the position of his dreams. The only problem? He has to conform and think inside the box created by Clifford Main (Ed Begley Jr.). This is not a situation that is conducive to ""Slippin' Jimmy's"" way of life. Meanwhile, Jimmy's relationship with Kim Wexler (Rhea Seehorn) is taken to another level, complicating her HHM lawyer-ship under Howard Hamlin (Patrick Fabian) and Chuck McGill (Michael McKean). Of course, Mike Ehrmantraut (Jonathan Banks) is always lurking around too, in this season putting the toll booth behind him for good and getting mixed up in some cartel business primarily involving Nacho Varga (Michael Mando), and also teasing an old Breaking Bad nemesis (whom I won't spoil for you here).

There is no doubt that I enjoyed watching this second campaign of ""Better Call Saul"". With the exception of maybe 1-2 episodes, they were all quite entertaining and full of that distinct Gilligan style. There is nobody on TV right now (or perhaps in history) that has told stories quite like Gilligan, combining tight stories with character drama and even a healthy dose of witty humor thrown in. Even the visual style of the show is unlike anything I've seen on TV since, well, ""Breaking Bad""! If you can get into that sort of thing, you'll savor this season much like you did the first.

The reason I can't give this the full five stars, however, is because it is significantly slower than anything previously (or anything on ""Breaking Bad""). I felt like the show was really, really taking its time and perhaps dragging its feet a bit. I don't want to criticize this aspect too much (and thus the solid 4-star ranking), but there were times where I wished the action would move along at a bit of a brisker pace. Even the first season covered significantly more ground and topics than this season. In a certain sense, though, perhaps this is inevitable for a show that can't get to its expiration date too quickly due to the sheer existence of ""Breaking Bad"".

Overall, I still enjoyed watching the second season of ""Better Call Saul"" each week, as there is nothing else like it on TV right now. I gave the first season four stars, and this slate gets the same treatment. It took me a couple of seasons to really buy into ""Breaking Bad"" too, though, and in that instance the third season pretty much blew my socks off! Perhaps a similar thing will happen here (as the show will indeed return for a third effort)...I hope so!","Feb 25, 2017",2
/user/id/916542355,4.5,"Spinoffs have always been a visible part of television programming. Some of the best have concentrated on a supporting character that grew to become a fan favorite. Although there are understandable exceptions, there is a generalization that the supply that the original series heavily influence the success of the spinoffs. One example that proves the veracity of this assertion is Better Call Saul,' one of the most popular series on the AMC basic cable network. In this case, the original program is still considered one of the groundbreaking series and the media, Breaking Bad.' Thats it was the epitome of one of my favorite themes and entertainment, the reason the man pushed beyond all sense of reason. Breaking Bad was correctly hailed as one of the most creative television shows ever noted for its Incredible writing, award-winning acting in a strong central theme capable of goring an audience in and keeping them captivated throughout the entire run of the show. The idea of a high school chemistry teacher with cancer using his knowledge to produce methamphetamine was brilliant. Initially, the justification the audience needed to accept a drug deal as a protagonist with the mitigating factor that he had terminal cancer and was trying to build the nesting take care of his family rapidly. During the progression of the series its primary focus migrated to the corruption of the innocent. As the schoolteacher became a powerful drug Lord, you had a need for a lawyer able to help them navigate the increasingly treacherous legal problem such a career is innately prone to have. That introduced the character Saul Goodman (Bob Odenkirk), the quirky yet very talented lawyer. The series Better Call Saul chronicles how a lawyer becomes involved in defense of very unscrupulous people. In its way, this series echoes many of the themes provided in Breaking Bad,' more accurately, how a person setting out to do something noble finds his efforts become corrupted. The first season of the series laid the groundwork by introducing the characters as the appearance and number of years before Saul Goodmans first appearance on Breaking Bad.' Now, in the second season, the story continues to provide a foundation that this man was a good lawyer deeply cared about his clients and doing the right thing. Now we get to witness despite good intentions a man can sink into a quagmire of moral ambiguity.

The man who would become Saul Goodman was born Jimmy McGill, the younger brother of a powerful and brilliant corporate attorney Chuck McGill (Michael McKean). Jimmy was always the smooth, reassuring kind of lawyer whos informal slogan ways ""Its all good, man,"" which with a touch of slurring become Saul Goodman. Jimmy has always been the protector and caregiver for his older brother who has a psychologically crippling form of the obsessive compulsive disorder that manifests in panic attacks and outright fear of electronics, electromagnetic hypersensitivity. Jimy was always willing to make the odd concession demanded by Chuck, including following all of his rules concerning divesting yourself of any electronic for entering his home. While working to help elderly patients of assisted care facilities, Jimmy stumbled upon systematic abuse by the corporate owners of those facilities. Ultimately, the class-action lawsuit on behalf of the patients would be a lucrative windfall for the lawyers representing their interests. Convinced by his best friend with benefits, Kim Wexler (Rhea Seehorn), that the scope of the case is far too long for one man, Jimmy agrees to take it to his brothers firm, Hamlin, Hamlin & McGill (HHM). Animosity has always existed between of the senior partners, Howard Hamlin (Patrick Fabian) and Jimmy. Jimmy devises a way for Chuck to leave the confines of his insulated and shielded home his older brothers able to return to his position of the founding partners of the firm. Jimmy receives a sundry position in the case but one that Jimmy exhibits the hard work and dedication, committed to obtaining the best settlement for the clients. In this season, the fact that Jimmy is ill-suited for the world of corporate law we received detailed elaboration providing insight as to why it was necessary for Jimmy to become Saul.

Eventually, he winds up accepting the offer made by the firm, Davis & Main. Despite receiving an incredibly well-furnished office, including a $7,000 desk, company car, and sizable signing bonus, Jimmy finds himself treating under the strict rules and regulations of corporate life. With every trial and tribulation, the Jimmy faces it brings them one step closer to becoming Saul Goodman.

Jimmy decides to go out on his own freeing himself from the oversight of others. His idea was to have Kim quit her job at HHM and join him as partners. She loves Jimmy and realizes that he cannot fit in any firm that he does not own, but, she is concerned that he likes to push the envelope bringing his actions dangerously close to unethical and even illegal behavior. She opens the shared workspace with them but as separate practices. Jimmy was always the type of lawyer with the needs of his clients about corporate protocol in the regulatory edicts of the American Bar Association. Flashbacks of demonstrated that Kim has a playfully larcenous streak of her personality. Just for fun, she would pick up a man at a bar, called Jimmy, and the two of them was a quick cash in a phony investment scheme. Despite that rebellious component of personality, Kim, the professional level is more comfortable within the confines of obeying the rules.

Theres something I can that amounts to a running gag that pervades the entire series, location of Jimmys offices. Initially, we see that Jimmy works out of a cramped storage room in the back of a Vietnamese nail salon. In that environment, hes struggling to get by but happy unlike his low furnished office Davis & Main, where he was on his rage was successful career yet miserable. A workspace that Jimmy plans to share with him as a repurposed, formal Dentist office, once again finding happiness in an environment not intended to house the practice of an attorney. Kim is working on building the unbreakable practice clients; Jimmy continues to concentrate more disreputable clientele. Jimmy leverages a couple of his clients in a registered sex offender to gain access to a U.S. Air Force base in a view to obtaining access to the B-29 aircraft in order to record motion video for his practice. One of the things I first got Jimmy into trouble in his old job has always been his creative use of the media. Just it is evident that Jimmy cannot change his fundamental way of doing business, Kim loses a major client to the intervention of Chuck. She begins to have misgivings about even sharing workspace with Jimmy

Another fan favorite character from Breaking Bad is Mike Ehrmantraut (Jonathan Banks), and exceptionally resourceful and successful criminal operative. He is a problem solver, the function that includes a variety of expertise. Mike had met Jimmy when he worked at a parking lot near the Albuquerque courthouse. The series has shown how this quiet man with a very dark past is constantly finding himself in morally ambiguous situations. He has a knack for thinking is way out of the most dangerous circumstances but when things go sideways is more than capable of defending himself. He was never quite an innocent person, but the series does depict how he was drawn inextricably into situations that deepen his criminal associations. Mike gains additional depth to the character established in the parent series. This tough, pragmatic fixer for hire does have a sentimental spot, his adult daughter, Stacey Ehrmantraut (Kerry Condon), and her daughter, Abigail Zoe Lewis (Faith Healey).

I had always found this concept interesting, knowing how certain finely detailed and well-depicted characters came to the place in life when we first encountered them. This series is technically a prolog for Breaking Bad,  but in contrast to the traditional tenants of concentrating on the primary character and themes that evolved into the story, the fan has come to enjoy so much. Instead, supporting characters step into the spotlight of center stage. We can see as we watch the movement from the first to a second season that what turned Jimmy into Saul is far from a simple matter. There are nuances embedded in this transition will have repercussions that will echo through the timeline to the main story. The problem intrinsically infused in any Prolog is that the audience is well aware of the outcome. We know how Jimmy and Mike turn out but the excitement of the journey. Thankfully by virtue of being a highly popular basic cable network AMC can take the required time to craft these transitions carefully.","Feb 20, 2017",2

/user/id/217342012,3.5,"Better Call Saul obviously had big shoes to fill, and has established itself throughout two seasons as less reliant on action and big climaxes than its parent. It mostly succeeds in this, thanks to maintaining Breaking Bads habit of inventive cinematography and crafting some slow-building greatness in some of its main characters, namely Rhea Seehorns Kim Wexler and Michael McKeans Chuck McGill, both of whom have a much more interesting presence here than in Season One. However, Better Call Saul seems to behaving a problem creating memorable characters in its supporting roles. While the odd supporter makes an impression, such as Jimmys film student lackies or Chucks gopher Ernesto, it still relies very heavily on bringing in familiar faces from Breaking Bad to fill its world, particularly in Mike Ehrmantrauts side story. Mikes story is generally a problem despite being interesting, as it stubbornly refuses to integrate into the main action. But even Jimmy/Sauls story in season two has its faults. It opens by effectively undoing the end of the previous season, only to spend a half-season building to the same point (in an admittedly more natural way). Odenkirk is still fantastic, and the camera work and family-based storyline make Better Call Saul a very worthwhile watch.

/user/id/793894576,4.5,"Introducing Jimmy McGill (played by Bob Odenkirk). You may know him
better as Saul Goodman, Walter White's slippery, resourceful lawyer in
Breaking Bad. When first we meet him it is a few years before he meets
Walter White. He is a struggling lawyer in Albuquerque, New Mexico. He
mostly defends small-time crooks and represents people in civil
liability claims (much of which amounts to nothing more than ambulance
chasing). His brother, Charles ""Chuck"" McGill (Michael McKean), is a
senior partner at a prestigious Albuquerque law firm but hasn't left
his house for several months due to a strange affliction. Jimmy is
supporting him through bringing him groceries and the like. Jimmy has a
dark, pre-lawyer past, being a small-time fraudster in Chicago before
moving to Albuquerque to start over and work with at his brother's
firm. We also meet Mike Ehrmantraut (Jonathan Banks), ex-cop now
working as a toll booth attendant at the courthouse parking lot. We see
how Jimmy and Mike's stories converge and how Jimmy slowly becomes the
Saul Goodman we know from Breaking Bad. 

Good drama series: engaging with some interesting episode-specific
stories and solid season/series-wide stories. Great character depth -
we see how Jimmy got to where he is and what makes him tick. Decent
depth to secondary characters too.

Not as compelling a watch as Breaking Bad though, especially during Season 1. Part of the problem
is you know how Jimmy/Saul is going to end up, and you want him to get
there as soon as possible. Saul Goodman was a wonderfully colourful
character in Breaking Bad - funny, very resourceful and not above
underhanded means to achieve ends. Jimmy McGill (in Season 1, at least)
isn't even a shadow of Saul Goodman. So the longer the Jimmy part is
drawn out and the Saul part delayed, the more impatient you get.

In Season 2 this is far less of an issue, as the sub-plots are good enough to stand on their own, without even knowing that Breaking Bad even exists.

Only other negative is that I find the character of Chuck quite irritating and always tend to feel anything involving him is a sideshow and a distraction from the main events.","May 25, 2016",2

I really want to like this show. It is very well acted and directed. But, it is just not very interesting. I blame lousy story concept and mediocre writing.

The legal aspect of the show is like badly written ""Ally McBeal"". And very dry and uninteresting. The rest is just really corny. The evil mentally ill brother as antagonist? Their twisted relationship is well-acted but also not believable or well written. The ever so uptight girlfriend who is just cool enough not to despise? How cliche is that? 

The really over the top and corny backstory is a real let down. A convicted con man - or any convicted criminal could NEVER get a bar card to practice law. Period. Most people know that so I guess we are asked to suspend belief. And a relatively well known lawyer changes his name mid-career in the same smallish city where everyone in the courthouse knows him? That's dumb.

In reality drug lawyers are usually the best and brightest attorneys. In the legal world a relationship with organized crime can be very lucrative and such relationships are coveted. The best and brightest tend to be the ""go to"" mob lawyers. Saul seemed to be a very sophisticated and high level player in Breaking Bad. I don't buy the leap from this to that Saul. 

Saul could have had a much more interesting back story. Him once being a highly paid corporate lawyer from the Ivy League who became a mob lawyer because he was bored, or had Daddy issues, or whatever -would have been much more believable and realistic - especially in the Breaking Bad universe.

Jimmy's transformation into Saul has grown even more complex, and Bob Odenkirk continues to play the heck out of this singular character.

Also, Saul's rivalry towards his brother reached some unexpected turns, even if the resulting cliff-hanger ending is a bit too simple a send-off for the intense episode that preceded it.

/user/id/971264966,4.5,"If you're looking for Breaking Bad Part 2, this isn't it.  It's something altogether totally different, even though it does feature some of the same characters.  First and foremost, it's much slower than BB, bc it actually focuses on character development vs plot development.  But don't worry, it does a very good job of hooking the viewers initially by bringing back some of our favourite villains from BB.  But from there it transforms itself into the Bob Odenkirk story, and that's actually a great thing for the show.  Saul Goodman is an unbelievable character and quite a story at that.  From his good intentions to his ""true to heart"" motivations, Saul is a character you can't help but root for.  And though he keeps getting the **** end of the stick for many of the episodes, we can't help but keep rooting for him, knowing eventually that he becomes the Saul we know from BB.
Kudos to the creators for not simply trying to reincarnate BB again, and instead making this a true spin-off, and featuring stories/characters in a totally different light than how they were portrayed in BB.  Bc this is a prequel to BB, we actually get a chance to see the characters evolve from where they start off here, to how they end up in BB.  BRAVO!","Apr 05, 2016",2

Nacho, to my surprise, actually has some really stand-out moments near the end of the season, and I can't wait to see what he does in season 4 (might be a spoiler, but it probably has to do with Gus Fring, whose role this time around isn't nearly as compelling as it was in BrBa). The lawyer and courtroom-related scenes this time around are the best of the series, and the dynamic between Jimmy/Saul and Chuck is the best part of the show, plus Jimmy's film student colleagues provide some nice comic relief.

Better Call Saul season 3 picks up where Series 2 left off and continues the messy life for one unfortunate lawyer. Much darker and more serious this time around with a little sprinkle of humor. Despite being a prequel and knowing some of the fates from certain characters, yet the consequences are there and makes for one gripping show.

You soon realize this season is not about Jimmy becoming Saul Goodman, but a deeper look into a toxic relationship on two brothers trying to poison each others careers - What started off lovable suddenly turns savage, and that alone is tragic enough. The show kicks in gears and pushes aside Mike for some real drama.

Bob Odenkirk and Rhea Seehorn are both terrific this season. The chemistry between them is complicated, but sweet and you really want things to work for them. Odenkirk calculated charm and Seehorn gorgeous dedication makes their characters complex. Not once are there outshine with everything going.

You love to hate Chuck, but love actor Michael McKean. He was fantastic this season and gives some of the best acting I've seen in awhile. Especially in the episode Chicanery where it finally showcases his acting abilities and became a personal highlight for me. What makes his performance so compelling is how he manages to switch back and forward from sympathy to ruthless. There are moments where you pity him, but quickly reminded hes one son of a b***h. Some of it through facial expressions and the deafening silence. Without spoiling anything, but the payoff to his character arc makes me more excited for season four.  

Jonathan Banks is brilliant once again as Mike. Making his side story thrilling to watch. Just the small details when getting things done makes him fascinating and also dangerous. He can switch personalities as well, but mostly pretend as to trick people than anything psychical like Chuck. Also having the most interactions with returned characters from Breaking Bad. 

Speaking of which...

In this season, Gus Fring makes a welcome return and oh boy, they didn't waste his screen time. Hes exactly the same as he was in Breaking Bad. Cold and sinister, but also got the brains which that alone is a dangerous tool for any psychopath. Giancarlo Esposito is excellent and really commands the screen whenever hes on. Even in episodes where Gus isn't present,  his presence is still felt. Theres a scene in where he takes out the trash and suspects someone is watching him in a far distance. Rather than turn around or show some worry, he freezes in place, back still turned to them, and has the blankest facial expression ever. Hes not the prey, but the predator.

Of course lets not forget the impressive camera work and the excellent dialogue which kept things afloat. Crafted with care and love, you can tell a lot of people behind the scenes are giving 100%. The show plays on your patiences, but if you stuck around from the beginning and your still here, you will know this by now. However your patience is always rewarded. 

My biggest complaint from season two is the endless amounts of cameos and feeling a little on the nose. While its understandable that Mike or Jimmy will get themselves into so much trouble, they end up meeting familiar characters, since it takes place in the state. I think its the presentation and their introductions are the real problem. Gladly those complaints dont apply with this season, as each and every individual of returned characters get plenty of memorable moments and felt purposeful this time around, like story wise. 

Overall Rating: Season three was pretty solid. Each season is slowly stepping in the shoes of Breaking Bad. While not flawless or re-watchable (after thinking back), yet never forgettable, as you only have to see this once for it to stay with you.","Jul 20, 2018",3

/user/id/783105400,5.0,"In terms of describing the events of the Third Season of ""Better Call Saul"", the less said the better (for fear of spoilers).  What I will say is this: The long-awaited, long-built confrontation between Jimmy (Bob Odenkirk) & Chuck (Michael McKean) finally occurs.  There is an entire episode built around Gus Fring (Giancarlo Esposito) and Hector Salamanca (Mark Margolis).  Kim Wexler (Rhea Seehorn) must find the balance between accommodating Jimmy and her own career.  Mike Ehrmantraut (Jonathan Banks) takes further steps to becoming the henchman we all know and love, while Nacho (Michael Mando) is seemingly playing all sides at once.

Instead of going into the details of the above plot lines, however, the most interesting thing to discuss about this Third Season is how fearless show creators Vince Gilligan and Peter Gould are in developing their vision for the show within the confines of the Breaking Bad-verse, if you will.  Most of the time, show creators don't want to touch a great work of art (and Breaking Bad is certainly that), but these guys revel in it!  They create an absolute perfect balance (roughly 50/50 in this third season) between Jimmy/Saul's origin story and basically being a Breaking Bad prequel.

Think of it this way: Imagine if, say, JJ Abrams & Damon Lindelof decided to create a LOST spinoff about the backstory of Ben Linus.  Sounds absurd, but that is basically what is happening here with the Jimmy/Saul character.  Fortunately, the show creators must love writing in this style/genre, as they have no trouble filling in all the blanks.  Only increasing the level of difficulty is the fact that if even the slightest tone or character arc is ""off"", everyone will know it because of BB's existence.  Remarkably, I've never once felt that way, as it is a seamless transition.

Up until this point, my one criticism of Better Call Saul was that it had a tendency to push the limits of how slow a story can be told.  While that is indeed the hallmark of Gilligan's writing (he takes his time and revels in the details), I thought the Second Season pushed that to the very edge.  Though I enjoyed that season, I sometimes found myself thinking ""man, this is moving along at a snail's pace"".  No such problem in Season Three.  In fact, this season covers a tremendous amount of ground.

In terms of acting, multiple Emmy nominations could be given out, as Odenkirk, Seehorn, Banks, & McKean are all well-deserving of the honor.  In all honesty, this cast has gelled even quicker than that of BB in the early goings.

Which brings me to my final (rather provocative) point: Through three seasons, I'd actually call BCS a better show than BB.  I know that isn't a 100% fair comparison (as Saul builds off of Bad, just in prequel form), but I think the point stands.  For me, it took BB two (or maybe even three) seasons really hold my rapt attention for every episode.  BCS has done that from episode #1, which this collection being easily the best so far.  S2 gave me a bit of pause because of the snail-like pace, but S3 vaults it into my top TV-watching experiences of all-time.","Jun 26, 2017",3

You'll be certain to catch a lot of Breaking Bad's cast this year (including the long-awaited return of Giancarlo Esposito as Gus Fring), but the writing never relegates their appearances to being mere fanservice, and there's always a mighty plot-development around the corner. Also like its parent series, Better Call Saul finds a delectable ratio for coming across as down-to-earth as well as singularly weird, with its two worlds (one seemingly of corporate America, and the other of organized crime) presented with equal degrees of intrigue, and connectivity. Of course, Gilligan and his cohorts know how to produce crime fiction unlike anything else on television, and some of this season's most impressive parts are elongated sequences often delivered with no dialogue, and they recall some of the great heist films of bygone eras (I.E. Jules Dassin's Rififi, or Michael Mann's Thief). With a season finale that is certain to shake up the series' status quo for next year, one should remain fully confident that Better Call Saul will continue to be one of television's most progressive and enjoyable series, and probably the best spin-off since Fraiser.","Jun 20, 2017",3

(Updated after Season 3).

Introducing Jimmy McGill (played by Bob Odenkirk). You may know him better as Saul Goodman, Walter White's slippery, resourceful lawyer in Breaking Bad. When first we meet him it is a few years before he meets Walter White. He is a struggling lawyer in Albuquerque, New Mexico. He mostly defends small-time crooks and represents people in civil liability claims (much of which amounts to nothing more than ambulance chasing). His brother, Charles ""Chuck"" McGill (Michael McKean), is a senior partner at a prestigious Albuquerque law firm but hasn't left his house for several months due to a strange affliction. Jimmy is supporting him through bringing him groceries and the like. Jimmy has a dark, pre-lawyer past, being a small-time fraudster in Chicago before moving to Albuquerque to start over and work with at his brother's firm. We also meet Mike Ehrmantraut (Jonathan Banks), ex-cop now working as a toll booth attendant at the courthouse parking lot. We see how Jimmy and Mike's stories converge and how Jimmy slowly becomes the Saul Goodman we know from Breaking Bad. 

Good drama series: engaging with some interesting episode-specific stories and solid season/series-wide stories. Great character depth - we see how Jimmy got to where he is and what makes him tick. Decent depth to secondary characters too.

Not as compelling a watch as Breaking Bad though, especially during Season 1. Part of the problem is you know how Jimmy/Saul is going to end up, and you want him to get there as soon as possible. Saul Goodman was a wonderfully colourful character in Breaking Bad - funny, very resourceful and not above underhanded means to achieve ends. Jimmy McGill (in Season 1, at least) isn't even a shadow of Saul Goodman. So the longer the Jimmy part is drawn out and the Saul part delayed, the more impatient you get.

In Season 2 this is far less of an issue, as the sub-plots are good enough to stand on their own, without even knowing that Breaking Bad even exists.

Only other negative is that I find the character of Chuck quite irritating and always tend to feel anything involving him is a sideshow and a distraction from the main events.  This is not the case in Season 3 though

Season 3 is where it all starts to come together.  Jimmy uses the name Saul Goodman for the first time and things with Chuck reach a breaking point, the fall-out from which pushes the series in a different, more interesting direction.  On Mikes front, a face familiar to Breaking Bad viewers appears and makes a profound impact.  This additional link with Breaking Bad helps to make you think the two stories are at last converging.

/user/id/828564903,4.0,"Better Call Saul is the prequel series to Breaking Bad that stars Bob Odenkirk reprise his role as the infamous lawyer Saul Goodman. Before he became Saul he was known as James McGill and he had an older brother named Chuck McGill, played by Michael McKeon, who hated and resented his younger brother becoming a lawyer much like him.  The first three seasons follows Jimmy as he struggles to convince his brother of the good he is doing practicing elderly law. But his brother always saw him as sleezy Jimmy. The cruelness of his brother caused him to loss his license by the end the third season and this last season we see Jimmy struggling to make ends meet and to be able to get back his license to practice again.  Jimmy isn't a bad guy at all, he is an all around good guy, with a great heart looking out for his loved ones and his clients.

Along the way, we see how Johnathan Banks became involved with Giancarlo Esposito to help set up the lab to cook the drugs.  We also see how his relationship develops with his daughter in law.  Looking forward to Season five and there will be a sixth of course in the coming years.  Definitely a great series different from Breaking Bad, definitely add this to your library.","Sep 01, 2020",4

Also, Mike's storyline is very good too, which marks the beginning of his journey with Gus. Again, I often found myself caring more about Mike's storyline than Jimmy's, which is really great to see.

In a series like this you expect evil and yet want the bad guy to get away with stuff, at least until the end (I think of Ralph Richardson as the main character in the British House of Cards).

/user/id/978148537,5.0,"In it's fourth season, Better Call Saul continues to showcase a display of immensely talented acting, writing, and directing. I feel like the gap between seasons three and four was a dividing line. The story being told is now different from the one before. The one before set up the one being told now, but it was a different story. Saul Goodman is now fully in motion after Chuck's death. He is firmly on the path towards proving Chuck right at every turn. This season features Jimmy and Kim teaming up in ways that couldn't have even been conceived of in the first three seasons. That is really a testament to the development of Kim Wexler as a character. Seehorn's subtlety and nuance blend beautifully in an authentic and lived-in performance. Coming out of this season and into the next one, the fate of Kim is one of my most pondered questions. Mike and Gus are finally together, and their storyline has begun to reach into the Breaking Bad world in an interesting, new way. Jonathan Banks continues to shine in his role, and the tragic inevitability of his character can be felt with every decision and even every moment (especially those with his daughter-in-law and granddaughter). Michael Mando's performance continues to be another one of my favorites, and Nacho is another character's fate I am curious to know. He has been through a lot, so it would be nice to see him get a break for once. As a side note, one minor thing among the numerous that make this show so damn great is that the writers have an uncanny ability to turn a hero into a villian and vice versa. It happened with Chuck and Howard in season one, and then it happened with Nacho in season three, and the best part is that it felt totally natural. Lastly, I had to mention Lalo. Why wasn't he introduced in season two?! Tony Dalton is excellent, and the character is both menacing and charismatic, ruthless and friendly, murderous and affable. I am sure there will be more to say in season five. Once again, Better Call Saul has proven to be better than just about anything else on television, and when is it okay to say that Breaking Bad might have some competition?","May 06, 2020",4

A show that took a Mamma Mia song and made it melancholic with sprinkles of sibling drama.

Every season, every year, this season gets stronger and stronger. ‘Better Call Saul Season 4', is TV excellence in magnificent fashion. I petty those who checked out after the slow burn season 1, because being overly spoiled at once, especially so early on, isn't how to develop the world and characters. If it this show was over spoilt, it would look like the later seasons of Game of Thrones.

Vince Gilligan is the G.O.A.T.

This season offers scenes that felt so disturbing with the emotional core feeling so real. The best compliment I can give to any show ever is it doesn't feel like a TV show where the behind the scenes are camera crew and actors. It's like am a fly on the wall, intruding on these people's lives and quite literally witnessing the final days of their lives.

How this season carries on with the death of Jimmy's brother Chuck is a brief, yet a devastating realization that Chucks death wasn't a sacrifice, but simply a man who was driven mad by the idea of his brothers success. Jimmy being the main cause of his death flips the morals of the characters on it's head. I hated Chuck, but I understood his illness was very serious and how it had a huge impact on the relationships with the people in his life. However, I felt bad for Jimmy, because of how his brother treated him. Just like ‘Breaking Bad', there are no good or bad characters. They are just characters with both good and bad in them.

Bob Odenkirk and Rhea Seehorn were both terrific this season. Odenkirk slow transformation into Saul Goodman that while it was an amazing character arc, but incredibly tragic, because I feel the reason why a lot of people checked out so early on is there wanted to see the lawyer from ‘BB', while not knowing the backstory to how he got there, which now gives you a different perspective on the character. Over time you start to notice the sleazy tone come out of him. Seehorn hasn't gotten the credit she deserves throughout the past seasons. Her reaction and silence says so much that words couldn't. I've always brought into the relationship between Jim and Kim. Lola Marsh ""Something Stupid"" montage between the two demonstrates it beautifully, which by the way if you watch the scene with earphones on, the track is splitted. So you can hear on the right one just the man's voice and the Jimmy clip, but on the left is just the Lola's voice and Kim clip. I'm not sure if this detail was intentional or not. Either way it adds to the scene wonderfully. However, by the end her faith in Jimmy has completely gone, as he completes the transformation to Saul. It was a sight for sore eyes.

Giancarlo Esposito is great once again as Gus Fring, especially Gus's sinister story that he tells to Hector to keep him alive and tortured, as part of his revenge. ""The merciful thing would have been to kill it.... I kept it"". - I mean god damn that's cold.

The cinematography in this season was absolutely excellent with a couple of perfectly framed shots implanted in my head. The very last shot of the very last episode when Mike kills Werner. No music, just night time silence with the sounds of footsteps on the sand. It's dark and almost hard to see, yet light enough to see the unfortunate that will happen. Wide shot in a wide space in a dark desert. Then a split second, a bright light coming from a gun which lights up the desert. A delayed gunshot sound from the distance. And then silence. Now we understand why Mike got so mad when Walt destroyed the lab in ‘Breaking Bad'. Jonathan Banks Emmy award is long overdue. Perfect episode to a great season.

He wasn't always Saul Goodman, ace attorney for chemist-turned-meth dealer Walter White. Six years before he begins to represent Albuquerque's most notorious criminal, Goodman is Jimmy McGill, a small-time attorney hustling to make a name for himself. He's a forceful champion for his low-income clients, an underdog whose morals and ambitions often clash. Jimmy works with private eye Mike Ehrmantraut, a former Philadelphia cop and recent transplant to the Southwest. Mike has a specialized skill set -- he's a ""fixer"" of sticky situations -- that Jimmy soon learns to appreciate. 
Before I discuss my overall thoughts on 'Better Call Saul' seasons 1-4, I'd like to briefly talk about the relationship I had with its predecessor. 'Breaking Bad' is, and forever will be, my favorite series of all time. I've watched a lot of TV shows, and it's the only one I've ever perceived as perfect, from start to finish. I've watched it all the way through probably 5 or 6 times (which I really don't know if I should be proud of that or not), and it's the only series that I believe is a 10/10. So back in 2015, when one of my favorite characters from that show was getting a spin-off, I was very excited to say the least. I'll admit however, my standards and expectations were set very high due to the quality of 'Breaking Bad'. 'Better Call Saul' is still a good show, but it's had its ups-and-downs for me. Despite already being on its 5th season (I've just recently finished the 4th, and will watch the 5th when it comes to Netflix), I'll save some time and discuss everything I've seen overall, rather than each individual season, because admittedly the show has flowed very well between its seasons and has maintained the same level of quality, so I feel like the positives and negatives I list can be applied to whichever season. I always like to start with positives first. 'Better Call Saul' is witty, great at developing its characters, as well as setting up its world and giving subtle hints and nods to 'Breaking Bad'. Many other great aspects that 'Breaking Bad' maintained such as cinematography, visuals, editing, and its signature montage-sequences, all have luckily transferred over to 'Better Call Saul'. It's also very intriguing to see how Saul operated before ultimately becoming who he is, and the slow developments and changes in his character, due to the many highs-and-lows he experiences. It also focuses on Mike (another one of my favorite characters from 'BB'), and I always liked seeing what they did with him as well. However, my least favorite aspect regarding the characters it focuses on may be the cartel. It just didn't feel nearly as interesting or consequential as in 'BB', and anything involving them kind of lost my interest in the show. I don't think I still was ever truly bored with the show, but there are admittedly lulls here and there. 'Breaking Bad' captivated me at every moment, yet with 'Better Call Saul' then it tends to meander and linger a bit, many times on very inconsequential and less interesting events. I understand that's the style they're going for, it's a less consequential show with a much different tone, following Saul in his every day life, however it just didn't always fully captivate me. My biggest grievance of the series is probably just its pacing and way of leading up to 'Breaking Bad'. I enjoy a nice, gradual progression into what events are to come later, however at many times 'Better Call Saul' felt like it wasn't really going anywhere. (LIGHT SPOILERS AHEAD) I still haven't gotten to Season 5 yet, but as of the end of Season 4 he is finally taking on the name of Saul Goodman, something that took quite awhile to get to. I just wanted more of that 'Breaking Bad' feel, and more of the sleazy Saul. I can respect its approach of depicting the events that gradually change Saul's behavior and moral-compass, but it just teased the viewer for longer than I felt it needed to. Its pacing and the inconsequentiality of its many sub-plots are really my only complaints with the show, but they're consistent enough to bump the score down from 8 to 7 for me. Overall 'Better Call Saul' is still a good, solid show, especially if you're a die-hard 'Breaking Bad' fan, although that's the only people I may recommend it to.

/user/id/803945697,5.0,"One of the most underrated shows on TV. A lot of people talk about how good breaking bad was, but this show is very much on par, if not better.

Having three ""completely distinct"" stories prevents this show from ever get stale or repetitive. With that being said, they interconnect and link in a very natural that brings things together organically. Nothing ever feels forced.

One of my favorite qualities about the show is the tempo. It is very slow. The director always takes time to set the scene. The camera zooms in, or out, occasionally panning across an old empty building when necessary. SOmetimes the shots are taken from afar and sometimes they're very up close. I don't know enough about filmmaking to name the types of tropes being used, but it is absolutely amazing. Watching Jimmy just bounce a ball against a door for 2 minutes is not boring. Having the Salamancas play a starring contest for 2 minutes adds another dimension to the show. A+

In addition, the 90s feel of the, combined with the emptiness of New Mexico really sets the mood. I feel like I enter another world every time I start watching the show.

Lastly, the show somehow makes me build very strong emotional ties to each character. Jimmy, Chuck, Kim, Nacho and Mike all hold a place in my heart, and I truly feel for them when they encounter difficulties.","Dec 01, 2018",4

Better Call Saul is a clever show that Breaking Bad fans, and comedy fans will enjoy.","Oct 14, 2018",4
/user/id/783105400,3.0,"After the second season of ""Better Call Saul"" aired, I criticized it a bit for being too slow (even for Vince Gilligan's standards).  A tremendous third season put that worry out of my mind.  With this fourth season, however, the show again treads the line (and I'd argue crosses it considerably) of being far too slow and ponderous.

I realize that Gilligan and Co. have a really tough job to do here in crafting a prequel to a show (""Breaking Bad"") that many consider to be the greatest of all-time.  So, they are going to get some criticism no matter which choices they make.  However, I wonder if the renewal of the show by AMC for TWO more seasons (this one and a fifth) turned this one into somewhat of a ""treading water"" campaign as the writers/producers position all the pieces towards the endgame.

There are two main plot lines this season examines:

First, and probably most importantly, is Jimmy's (Bob Odenkirk) ""grief"" (or lack thereof) over brother Chuck's (Michael McKean) death.  Though Kim (Rhea Seehorn) tries to get Jimmy to open up during his one-year suspension from the law, Jimmy isn't having it, content to completely shut Chuck out from his thoughts and continue to ""hustle"" (now mucking around in the cell phone business) until he can get his law license back.

Simultaneously, Gus (Giancarlo Esposito) is starting construction on his underground super meth lab, and Mike (Jonathan Banks) is overseeing the process.  Of course, things don't quite go as planned (when do they ever in the criminal underworld?!) and hard choices must be made.  At the same time, Gus continuously deals with intrusions from the Salamanca family, which puts Nacho (Michael Mando) in some really tough positions.

Here are the two main problems I had with this installment of episodes:

1. The meth lab construction plot feels reallllllly drawn out and, even worse, never does resolve itself fittingly.  Gus (and Mike, by associate) were used in much better capacities in season three.  Even Nacho is set up with a great angle at the beginning of this season, and then just sort of fizzles out as it goes along.  Perhaps BCS isn't as good of a match for the ""deep cartel stuff"" as BB was.

2. For most of this show, it seems to be set up that the conflict between Kim and Jimmy will always come down to her wanting to be a serious lawyer and him content with being more of a huckster.  They turn those characterizations on their heads in S4, and not to a great result, as it feels like kind of a bait-and-switch.  As a character, Kim does/says things in the final few episodes here that seem completely out of place considering everything we've seen of her previously.

The bottom line for S4 of BCS is this: The heart of this show will always be Jimmy/Saul, and they play the long game with that here.  This entire season, fans are looking for him to reconcile Chuck's death, and Vince Gilligan stubbornly refuses to trod that path until the finale, where even then viewers are thrown for a bit of a loop.  I'd argue that this long approach makes the show feel bloated and not nearly as on-point as S1-3.  Couple this with the auxiliary angles (Gus, Nacho, Mike) falling extremely flat, and that's not a great recipe for success.

Now, by no means am I ready to give up on BCS.  Even at its worst (this season) it is still very watchable (hence the 3-star rating).  I'm hoping that the upcoming fifth season (almost surely the last) will once again find that sense of urgency in rounding Jimmy/Saul's story full circle.","Oct 13, 2018",4

/user/id/790605600,4.0,"The slow burn of Jimmy and Kim's  relationship and Jimmy's ethics continues. I'm not sure that this works as well as it did with Breaking Bad. In Breaking Bad, we know the character arc at the beginning: Walt is going to go from meek college teacher to drug dealer who does horrible things to make it in that world.  Maybe my moral gray area is too wide, but I never found the Saul character as reprehensible; for sure, he helps some nasty people get away with bad shit, but he's also a lawyer for people who get no respect in the legal system. He is  pretty good at what he does, and he enjoys it; his character is mainly played for comic relief in BB. So the dark, foreboding tone of BCS sometimes doesn't work for me precisely to the extent that it is a prequel. I wish Jimmy could have hung on to Kim, for his sake, but I don't particularly wish that he had ""made it"" in a big, corporate law firm, and I don't particularly care if he ever stops cutting corners. It doesn't seem like his best self really cares about those things, though at times he thinks he should. The character in BB doesn't seem to think that his career is tragic; in fact, he kind of loves it.

So I enjoy the atmospheric tension, but there's something kind of jarring about it, too. What works for me more in this season is a few great character moments with Mike and Gus, and the relationship between Mike and Werner is genius, tragic, lends depth to Mike's character, and also is a kind of a relationship between two late middle aged men that you don't often see on TV or in film.","Oct 09, 2018",4

While last season saw the departure of Chuck, Saul's conflict with his brother continues this season, and the heart-break is even more powerful than ever. It's devastating knowing that Jimmy's final transformation into Saul is about one tragedy away now, but the best scenes this season really find the character at his most humane. It's not all Jimmy's show though, as Mike also has some of his best sub-plots this year, and love interest Kim has become such a key player in this universe that it almost feels like she had an unseen role in Breaking Bad (probably did!). As of this writing, it seems likely that Vince and co. may want to conclude Better Call Saul next season and this would be perfectly fine. Season four's momentum and character growth make it the ideal penultimate year.","Oct 08, 2018",4

/user/id/977456586,5.0,"Not many spin-offs can claim to be their own show. Better Call Saul is most definitely one of them. 

If anything, Disney should take note from this Netflix Original in order to learn how to perfect the sequel, although this may be a prequel. Better Call Saul has enough homage to it's roots in Breaking Bad to take place in it's mundane New Mexico universe, but doesn't ever once rely on it's references for its foundations as a tv series. Sure, it uses old characters from the Breaking Bad, but there are new archs to explore and learn how the underground meth war was constructed before Walter White ever gets involved. Like the new Blade Runner, this is not a side dish to the Breaking Bad main course, Better Call Saul is it's own Sunday roast. 

A fascinating look upon justice in modern day America, Jimmy's constant struggle for excellence in the law conflicts outstandingly with his own interpretation of what in this world constitutes as ''Justice''. His brother, Chuck, is his perfect counterpart. He and Jimmy collide in what is lawful verses what is just and fair. It's an introspective look upon how life is determined by those that run it. Overall, the show seems to state that although Saul Goodman (Jimmy) may work for shady drug dealers and back-alley crooks, he actually stands up for a real sense of justice against an established governing law that restrains fair-play, disregards morality in place of what is written in the law and genuinely feels more arbitrary than any logical system of ethics. At the end of the day, Jimmy uses shady politics to dismantle a Law system, that opts for traditions riddled with corruption, in order to find a sense of moral balance. It's the dirty lawyer is a heart of gold verses clean man with a gun in your back. Outstanding television.","Sep 04, 2018",4

It's the most ""Breaking Bad"" feeling season out of all, but it still keeps the same dark comedy vibes from the previous seasons. Jimmy is a pretty different character than he was before, but he still is the same person. That's a very complicated thing to pull off in a TV show, and once again, the writers manage to do it with ease. The writing has been very consistent throughout the entire series, but it stands out even more here, in my opinion. The acting is honestly better than it was last season, characters like Kim, having more depth added to them, which required a more impactful performance form the actors, and they delivered.

/user/id/978557932,2.0,"The show has become rather dull and predictable. Dull, because the pace drags as much as the first season - I'm glad I can fast forward on the streaming server to skip through the long, boring panoramic shots and long silences with the actors staring into the distance. They are just padding out the time to extend to 6 seasons - there's only about 5 episodes worth of real material here.
Predictable, because Jimmy/Saul is - guess what - up to the same tricks you've seen him pull for the preceding 4 seasons - where's the character arc, doesn't the guy ever learn? Gus is just the same creepy ruthless gangster he was before - now prone to long, brooding silences as if they couldn't think of any dialogue for him. Something is wrong about all the characters here and Kim's sudden change of character/decision making doesn't make sense. Mike has become a cardboard plodding character in this season - nothing different or new or revelatory to develop his arc.
The problem overall with BCS is that they have stretched it out too long, and is suffering from the plague that has lumbered Hollywood franchises recently - that of splitting the final part into 2 movies to make more money. The problem here is that that's happened with at least 2 seasons of BCS. Season 1 was slow and lost a lot of fans of Breaking Bad - not one of my friends who liked BB stayed with BCS season 1 beyond about episode 3 or 4. Seasons 2 and 3 I thought were good, with a lot happening and a lot of back story to tell, as well as some good character development.
Then came season 4, which took twice as many episodes as it needed to tell the story of Jimmy's disbarment and Gus's lab building project. Realistically, that season and this one could have been combined in one. Also annoying is that the opening episode's present day B/W footage just isn't really going anywhere - after 5 seasons I would have expected SOME sort of story to be emerging but it's still unclear.
This whole series is really only worth about 4 seasons max. I'll watch the final season, but only because I want to know where the present day story is going; I'm just not really invested in the characters anymore.","Jul 14, 2020",5

My biggest issue with season 5 is that the character of Kim seems to be a completely different person and her change feels rushed and not believable. Everyone loved the episode with Jimmy and Mike in the desert but what was the point? We know that both characters survive so all of the tension is gone. Also Breaking Bad already did an episode where Walt and Jesse got stranded in the desert so they are clearly running out of ideas.

/user/id/978148537,5.0,"50% off!!! Actually, the newest season of Better Call Saul is anything but 50%. After waiting forty episodes, we finally get to see Jimmy McGill practicing law as Saul Goodman. He has arrived! And despite the joy I had seeing him finger-point at Kim and say ""s'all good, man"" at the end of season four, I am also sad that the journey is coming to a close. However, with two seasons remaining, the story has reached it's finest moments. Without a doubt this is the best season so far, and it is one of my personal favorite seasons of television ever. Bob Odenkirk proves why he is such an underrated actor, and the creative team once again shows off their brilliance. The story is bigger, more intense and with greater stakes. Our two worlds of the law and the cartel meet destiny in this season and it makes for some unbelievable entertainment. Lalo is back, and now that he has been on for a full season I can gush about how good the character is and also how good Dalton is in the role. He's a charismatic, gregarious personality that steals each scene he's in. Definitely one of the better TV villians out there. Kim's inner conflict is also a large point of focus here. She has been slowly corrupted by Jimmy's disposition and shenanigans, but her good-natured being continues to fight it. This usually ends with her justifying a questionable action that not only cuts corners but even steps outside of the law itself. We saw it in season four, and it's even more prevalent here. Mike's descent into becoming the man he feared becoming back at the start of the show is both fascinating and tragic, and Nacho's uncertain fate lingers well after the credits roll on episode 10. I could talk about this show for hours, and after five superb seasons of riveting, complex and overall entertaining television, it would be a disservice to not place Better Call Saul alongside Breaking Bad. They're two of the finest shows ever made, and I am grateful to be alive to see them in real time.","May 08, 2020",5

I'm continuously amazed at how great this show is. Every single season manages to give me more of what I'm looking for, but remain original, invigorating and exciting.

The one constant between every single season is the mood and feel that the directors create. The emptiness of the desert, the wide screen shots, as well the balance of Jimmy's humour, excitement, terror and failure. The cinematography is amazing, but I'm not at liberty to comment on it due to my lack of knowledge. I love watching the fight scenes, the shooting sequences, but also a car simply driving through the desert for hours on end. They're all visually appealing in different ways and set the mood in a very well calculated manner.

The difference between every season is how it is not repetitive at all. Some characters remain, others die, some are introduced, but it never gets dull. This is one of the few shows that has true character development, and it is fascinating to see the series of events that lead each of them to change.

There's no question that Bob Odenkirk and Jonathan Banks always delivered magic when performing together, and it reaches an apex with this season's episode Bagman. As intense, rich, and satisfying an hour of television you're likely to ever experience, the episode ranks alongside other masterstroke episodes like The Sopranos' Pines Barrens and Breaking Bad's Ozymandias as one that ultimately defines the entire series. While the stakes remain high all season, the show still has an indelible sense of humor, and not just on Odenkirk's part. Tony Dalton also gives a high-spirited performance as antagonist Lalo Salamanca, and Rhea Seehorn's chemistry with Odenkirk is more charming than ever, even though there is such gravitas to it as well. As said before, Jimmy's descent into Saul Goodman has been nuanced and deceptive, but we can tell Kim will be the supernova in this transformation.

I think the showrunners made a major mistake by turning this into a soap opera about the origins of the characters. The storyline is terribly slow, wobbles all over the place, and ultimately makes the Breaking Bad characters less interesting and impressive because it tells us too much about them. I used to find Mike scary. Now he's a sympathetic character. I used to find Saul funny. Now he's a tragic figure. I used to find Fring mysterious and creepy, almost supernatural. Now he's just another gangster. The magic is gone.
There's a lot of value in having under-explained or mysterious backstories, then someone makes a prequel and throws it all away. Talking about some epic event that happened in the past is a lot more powerful than showing it on the screen. Unfortunately, they're having so much fun making this show they've forgotten that.  We're seeing every detail of these peoples' lives, and it's just weakening the original story. No magic. Gone.
While the writing and acting are superb, and there are stories worth watching, the show meanders all over the place (I actually fall asleep sometimes) and the choice of topic is all wrong.

Wow,  from the creators of arguably the best tv series of all time is perfecting a spin-off that had little but no chance to live up to the hype.  But it does, and it's great.  It wants you begging for more.  I am even hoping this series goes further than season 6. The acting is phenomenal along with the story lines.  Even the most boring scenes are turned into gold!  Kim Wexler, who was one of my least favorite characters, is now ranked up there as one of my favorites.  This story build up has a breaking bad touch,  but could be a show on its own!!!  I'm telling you, the suspense is absolutely incredible. I almost had to pop a Xanax during the previous episode it's that good! Hope this helps from anyone who may of doubted this show.  If you loved breaking bad as much as I did, you will love this show, but either way it's great. This show is probably better to binge on Netflix as I have been watching week to week painfully waiting for the new episode to air!","Apr 15, 2020",5

/user/id/852526487,5.0,"Just when I thought this show couldn't possibly get any better, Season 5 raises the bar and the stakes even higher, to a dizzying level. If we ever doubted whether or not Saul actually deserved to end up where he eventually ends up, it's becoming clear now that when Saul arrives at that inevitable fate we all know is coming, he has fully earned it; with every decision, and with every step he makes, he's one moment closer to that fate. Even as he fights against it with tepid resignation, we watch with excitement and also a heavy heart, as he gives way to the current and starts to drift away. Converging to make his fate and losses all the more tragic. What I'm enjoying most from this season is the plot construction, or should I say deconstruction, of Kim and Saul's romantic relationship. We start to feel the strain and tension tighten in the relationship between Kim (Seehorn's facial expressions and body language are nuances and brilliant, conveying so much of what's right below the surface, but only occasionally reaches her lips in angry, tense snippets of dialogue) and Saul (who is desperate to hold on to their relationship, yet to scared to talk about it's issues even though he's fully aware of them). Play acting and pretending in the face of uncomfortable, emotional, or tricky topics and situations has always been Saul's go to safety net; in fact his whole life is starting to become an act, even down to his name change. But when it comes to his relationship with Kim, his instinct to ""act it all away"" goes into overdrive. The second he smells tension between them, he masks his concern with a cheery exterior and suggestions of house buying and movie night. It's almost as if he has a childlike level of emotional intelligence; ""if I just pretend everything is ok, maybe it will make it true"". Even when Kim snaps at him over his suggestion of play acting (LYING) to manipulate a client into taking a plea deal when he wants to unadvisedly go to trial, his face and eyes register the deepest of shock and hurt (Odenkirk and Seehorn knock it out if the park in this scene), as if she's just slapped him hard across the kisser; then quickly he stuffs it down and is ""All Good Man"" once again. Even though in his heart of hearts, we know he senses everything is far from ""all good"". Seehorn plays this scene and the subsequent aftermath as if she can feel tiny bits of her soul disappearing; there's an undercurrent of bitterness and resentment towards Saul's blurred ethics that's starting to show. But also, we register a bitterness and resentment towards Saul AND herself when those blurred ethics hint at rubbing off on her, and a desperation to prove to herself that she's not THAT person (this plays out brilliantly in scenes with an elderly man at Mesa Verde who refuses to budge, and who has a tongue that cuts like a knife) as she uneasily does something that she just consciously protested against. The undercurrent of this moment feels far reaching, and I don't think we've seen the last of its repercussions on their relationship. We are witnessing the unraveling of two people who desperately want to find a way. Even though each of their ways live in completely different continents. We are witnessing the start of each of their paths beginning to pull in separate directions, and we listen as their silences speak volumes. It urges the questions-How much of our souls can we sell and negotiate away, before nothing of who we are remains, not even our own name? When do we decide to leave someone we love, because we no longer recognize who they are anymore? And when we're with them, we begin to not even recognize ourselves? Not to leave the other plot lines, characters and actors out, because everything shines in this season. Its literally ALL GOOD MAN. And completely worthy of repeat viewings. Stellar, refined, knockout and nuanced performances as always from Odenkirk and Seehorn, who are clearly at the very top of their game here. Not to spoil anything, but look out for a couple of old friends to turn up this season, as we inch ever closer to the beginning timeline of the show that gave us this show 😉With the rest of the cast and characters turning in fine, compelling performances of their own brilliant story lines, it's a show and season that's expertly acted, written and directed, all the way around. It's a show and season at the very top of the best viewing possible in any medium, and in every form. We're also treated to outstanding writing, cinematography and direction for one of the best shows in the history of television. It gets no better than this my friends.","Mar 15, 2020",5

/user/id/978242889,0.5,"Spoilers ahead: The way Howard's character is completely disrespected in episode 8 ending with his conclusion is just disgusting writing that is reminiscent of The Walking Dead S02EP11 (again spoilers) when Dale is killed off in the most ludicrous way - which is why I stopped watching that garbage of a show as well. At least with Ignacio's exit, the circumstances made sense and tied into the story in a natural way, and the character wasn't disrespected. 

 Saul and Kim's characters are completely dislikeable in this season which is why I started watching this show. Their motivations for ruining Howard's life make absolutely no sense, both on paper and seeing it acted out. Does not feel realistic or natural for those characters, makes me wonder if I'm still watching the same show. Even Howard, who I feel is supposed to represent the audience perspective, sums everything up correctly. And yes, I get the artsy-fartsy symbolism that killing Howard is like killing the audience. This is unforgiveable, bad writing, and a completely disrespectful way to exit a character. I can only hope the writers that thought this was a great idea never find work in Hollywood again, but with the almost meteoric rise of the amount of bad television (Halo comes to mind) who am I kidding?","May 26, 2022",6

It's a little too easy for Saul to manipulate them. Sorry, things don't work quite so predictably in real life. There was a playful exuberance in Saul's character in previous seasons that's totally missing now. The humor is muted. I somehow can't take the childish pranks he and Kim are playing on Hamlin seriously. Why? What's his motivation? He already did the bowling ball and prostitute stunts, and to keep on with this nonsense feels like bullying. Where is the beauty of the photography that framed the action in BREAKING BAD? The shot of the blooming flower in the austere desert was nice, and there are some other original touches, but I miss the artistry. The self-sacrifice of another character (I won't specify who) feels pointless and lacks resonance.","May 01, 2022",6
